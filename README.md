## EMPOWERING THE NATION
As part of a Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) project, the mobile application Empowering the Nation was created. The app promotes a nearby small-to-medium business (SME) that offers gardeners and domestic workers beneficial skill training. The app's user-friendly design makes it easier to browse courses, calculate fees, and manage contacts, all of which increase accessibility and user engagement.

The app reflects our group’s commitment to creating an impactful and functional solution by combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, aligning with real-world professional expectations.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND

Empowering the Nation was established in order to address the shortage of formal training possibilities for gardeners and domestic workers. By providing a range of six-month programs and short courses, the organization gives people useful skills that help them land better jobs or launch their own small enterprises.

Our job was to create a mobile application that supports the organization's objectives, expands their audience, and makes interacting with potential customers easier. For the project to produce an app that is accessible, professional, and easy to use, user interface (UI) design concepts, feature development, and cooperative teamwork had to be integrated.
